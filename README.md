## Application Description

Our project is a mobile application developed using React Native. It allows users to record and store memories with location data, images, and audio recordings. The app utilizes GPS for location determination, enabling users to add memories to a map. Users can also listen to recorded audio memories and view their memories in a visual format.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: The core of our application, React Native allows us to build native mobile apps using JavaScript, combining declarative UI building and efficient state management.

- **Expo**: We use Expo to streamline development, providing a comprehensive toolkit for React Native, including multimedia features. We employ the "image-picker" library to simplify image selection and handling.

- **expo-av**: For audio management, we use the "expo-av" library, enhancing the app's audio-related features.

- **Firebase**: Firebase serves as our primary cloud-based storage solution for audio recordings and images. It offers a cloud-based database and file storage service.

- **SQLite Database**: We use an SQLite database for local data storage and management, providing an efficient way to handle data on the device.

- **React Navigation**: React Navigation powers our app's navigation, ensuring smooth transitions between different views.

- **Geocoder**: For location geocoding, we rely on the Geocoder library, translating GPS coordinates into understandable addresses.

- **Google Maps API**: The integration of the Google Maps API enhances our location-based features, enabling map interactions, location views, and memory placements.

- **AsyncStorage**: AsyncStorage, a React Native feature, stores lightweight data such as user preferences, simplifying the management of small data sets in the device's local storage.

## About
